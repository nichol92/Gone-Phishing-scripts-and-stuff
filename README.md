# Gone-Phishing-scripts-and-stuff
task's that need doing:
python Script;
  1. Get a hold of the big list of MAC address vendors that comes with WireShark. Find it on the
  PC or on-line.
  – If you don’t know what a MAC address is, ask or google it.
  – Write a program in Python that accepts a partial MAC address and then uses this list to
  identify the vendor.
Bash Script;
  2. The directories /proc and /dev contain useful information about running processes, the machine
  you’re using and more.
  – Write a program in Bash script that looks in these directories and presents easy-to read
  information.
  – This is an information-gathering tool, so think about what might be useful in a pen-test or
  forensic investigation.
  – A good starting point might be to get machine specs, but if you can, go on to extract
  information on running processes and more.
c program
  – Your group needs to hide some sensitive information from competitors. Some secret manifesto.
  – Write a program in C that asks for a password and then, if the password is correct, displays
  this sensitive information.

These need to be done by monday!!!!
• All of your code needs to be checked in to GutHub before Monday next week. This is important! You
will be pointed at, tutted at and generally be made to feel uncomfortable if you don’t.

We will allocate people to code each script/program but make sure you save all your versions to github so that we have something by monday and so that other people can help you to finish the script. This also means you should b adding comments to all of your code and if you make an edit to the git hub version save it has a new version (ie if you edit version 1.0 save it has version 1.1) and try to make it evident what chenges you made.
